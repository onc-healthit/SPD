<h2>Synthetic Data Provider (SPD) FHIR Resource Generation</h2>

This project contains the Java application(s) that will read data from the SPD and/or SPD_Scrubbed schemas on  the SPD VM and generate
various FHIR Resource data files.  The FHIR profiles used for generation are the VHDIR_* FHIR profiles as defined in the VHIR implementation 
guide (IG) located at http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/VhDir/index.html

The application uses the HAPI FHIR Java resources as a base, further information of which may be found at http://hapifhir.io/
